## [0.57.1] - 2022-03-21

## [0.55.2] - 2021-11-17

### Changed

- [no longer set DOTNET_HOST_PATH, instead preferring some F#-specific build parameters](https://github.com/ionide/proj-info/pull/127). This should be safer for more categories of applications.

### Fixed

- [fix the dotnet binary probing logic to not use the host app name](https://github.com/ionide/proj-info/pull/126)

## [0.54.1] - 2021-10-16

### Fixed

- Added more environment variable lookups for the `dotnet` binary, so modes like running under `dotnet test` should work more consistently.

## [0.54.0] - 2021-08-08

### Added

- The save path for binary logs can now be set

### Changed

- Reverted to FCS 39 for compatibilties' sake
- Removed dependency on MsBuild.Locator
- Massively improved compatibility for cracking projects on a broader range of SDK versions
- Fixed a regression in the MSBuild Graph Workspace Loader that resulted in it not working on SDKs greater than 5.0.10x
- centralized the setting of process-level MSBuild and dotnet SDK environment variables into the `init` function, extracting them out of the individual workspace loaders. this should ensure a consistent experience regardless of loader chosen.
