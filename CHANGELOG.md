## [0.54.1] - 2021-10-16

### Fixed

- Added more environment variable lookups for the `dotnet` binary, so modes like running under `dotnet test` should work more consistently.

## [0.54.0] - 2021-08-08
### Added

- The save path for binary logs can now be set

### Changed

- Reverted to FCS 39 for compatibilties' sake
- Removed dependency on MsBuild.Locator
- Massively improved compatibility for cracking projects on a broader range of SDK versions
- Fixed a regression in the MSBuild Graph Workspace Loader that resulted in it not working on SDKs greater than 5.0.10x
- centralized the setting of process-level MSBuild and dotnet SDK environment variables into the `init` function, extracting them out of the individual workspace loaders. this should ensure a consistent experience regardless of loader chosen.
